•	The project leverages Python programming language along with popular NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), spaCy, and scikit-learn.
•	Implement data preprocessing steps, including tokenization, lemmatization, and handling of special characters
•	 These libraries provide essential tools and algorithms for text processing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and word embedding. 
•	Additionally, the project incorporates advanced techniques like language modelling, n-gram modelling, and sequence prediction to generate accurate and	contextually	relevant suggestions
•	Significantly increased typing efficiency by offering accurate and context-aware word suggestions, minimizing keystrokes.
